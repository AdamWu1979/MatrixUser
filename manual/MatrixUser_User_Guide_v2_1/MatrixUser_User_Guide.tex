\section{What is MatrixUser}
Most of the medical images (e.g. CT, MRI, PET, etc.) comprises multiple frames which represent slices, phases, timing etc. from the same imaging object. With the powerful support of multidimensional data representation, those images can be saved as multidimensional matrices in Matlab. However, within Matlab, most of image manipulation functions are limited or tailored for two-dimensional matrix. The MatrixUser is a matrix analysis software package which features functions designed and optimized specifically for manipulating multidimensional real or complex data matrix. Within a nice graphical representation, image analysis including multidimensional matrix display, matrix (image stack) processing and rendering can be conveniently accomplished with minimum efforts.\\

The current MatrixUser version (v2.1) is made available at SourceForge website. MatrixUser is released as a free software. This means that you are free to use and modify this software as your needs, as long as you acknowledge the original author in any future work. If you find MatrixUser useful for the publication of any scientific results, including a line in your acknowledgments section referencing to MatrixUser and this belowing address is requested.\\
\\
MatrixUser downloading address:
\begin{center}
\url{https://sourceforge.net/projects/matrixuser/}
\end{center}

\section{Installing and Running MatrixUser}

To run MatrixUser, a Matlab installment is required. The current MatrixUser version has been tested under the following Matlab versions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Matlab R2011a 64-bit Windows
\item Matlab R2013a 64-bit Windows
\item Matlab R2012b 64-bit Unix
\end{itemize}

Installing and running MatrixUser is easy, you just need to download MatrixUser source code which is distributed as a compressed file, then extract the MatrixUser root folder, put the folder to any location in you computer. To run MatrixUser, start Matlab, then simply run the `Main.m' script under the MatrixUser root folder. \\

The MatrixUser main window (Figure \ref{fig:MatrixUser}) works as a matrix manager.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Pictures/MatrixUser.eps}
	\caption{MatrixUser Main Window}
	\label{fig:MatrixUser}
\end{figure}


\section{Data Import}

Current MatrixUser version supports displaying any valid Matlab multi-dimensional matrix and Matlab structure variable. By default, MatrixUser reads Matlab base workspace, scans existing matrices in the Matlab session, then creates a matrix list for tracking matrix content. Once those matrices are updated by the user, MatrixUser will also update the matrix list. Moreover, there are several different approaches to import data from outside Matlab into MatrixUser. The imported matrices will be saved into Matlab base workspace. The import functions are located under `Load' menu, including:

	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Load MAT file

The default Matlab .mat file is natively supported by MatrixUser.

	\item Load System Clipboard
	
If image content exists in the system clipboard, it can be converted into a RGB image which contains a three slice matrix with each slice corresponds to the individual Red, Green and Blue channel.

  \item Load ScreenShot

MatrixUser takes a full screenshot for current monitor and saves it into a RGB image as described above.
	
	\item Load from Binary file

Binary data file is supported by MatrixUser. The user needs to properly configure loading parameters (Figure \ref{fig:LoadFromBinary}) according to the matrix size and data type information.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Pictures/LoadFromBinary.eps}
	\caption{MatrixUser Binary File Loading Interface}
	\label{fig:LoadFromBinary}
\end{figure}	

 \item Load DICOM file(s)
		
MatrixUser supports loading multiple DICOM files by using a file filter interface (Figure \ref{fig:LoadFromDICOM}). The user needs to load DICOM files into the loading interface by selecting desired DICOM files (multiple selection supported). The selected files are listed in the DICOM file list. The user can click any single DICOM file to read associated DICOM header and image preview. To manually create a matrix using DICOM files, choose files from the DICOM file list, press `$>>>>>>$' to push the files into selected DICOM file list, provide a matrix name, press `Convert' button to create a matrix based on chosen DICOM files. The user can load those created matrices into base workspace by pressing `Load matrix' button.
		
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Pictures/LoadFromDICOM.eps}
	\caption{MatrixUser DICOM File Loading Interface}
	\label{fig:LoadFromDICOM}
\end{figure}	

\item Load DICOM file(s) in Batch

MatrixUser supports loading DICOM files in a batch mode. This function requires the path of the folder containing DICOM files is provided. MatrixUser will try to create separate matrices for DICOM files coming from different image series. A matrix selection interface will provide converted matrices with loading functions.

\item Load from NIfTI file

NIfTI file with .nii suffix is supported by MatrixUser.
		
\end{itemize}


\section{Window Layout}

To activate MatrixUser display window, press `MatrixUser' button. If the selected matrix contains complex value, four options are available for displaying magnitude, phase, real and imaginary of the matrix. Figure \ref{fig:MatrixUserDisplayPanel} demonstrates an overview of the window layout of the MatrixUser display window. The window consists of 


\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Pictures/MatrixUserDisplayPanel.eps}
	\caption{MatrixUser Display Window}
	\label{fig:MatrixUserDisplayPanel}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}

	\item Matlab Default Toolbar  \\
	
	Matlab toolbar provides basic interactive functions for displaying matrix. These functions include:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/SaveFig.eps} : Save current image axes into an image file
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/ZoomIn.eps} : Zoom in matrix area
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/ZoomOut.eps} : Zoom out matrix area
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/Pan.eps} : Manually move matrix position
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/DataCursor.eps} : Check individual voxel value and index
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/Print.eps} : Print current figure
		\item \vcenteredinclude{Pictures/Colorbar.eps} : Turn on/off color bar
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item MatrixUser Function Library \\
	
	Most of the matrix analysis functions are represented on function bench panel. MatrixUser groups these functions into categories and dynamically loads them according to
	the dimension size and compatibility of current display matrix. A multi-tab is used to contain individual function button associated with each function. 
	The tabs under the multi-tab are used to switch between function categories, which include
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Display : Multi-dimensional matrix display functions
		\item QuickMath : Perform math calculation for current matrix
		\item Transform : Transform current matrix
		\item Process : Basic matrix processing functions
		\item ROI : Region-of-Interest functions
		\item Segment : Segmentation functions
		\item Surface : Generate surface or mesh plot for current image
		\item Matlab : Matlab default image tools
		\item More : Uncategorized functions
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Matrix Calculator \\
	
The matrix calculator consists of three control items, including a matrix expression editbox, an execution button (\vcenteredinclude{Pictures/MatrixCalc.eps}) and a matrix saving button (\vcenteredinclude{Pictures/Upload.eps}). Valid matrix calculation expression can be executed in the calculator and updated in the display window, serving as a convenient way to analyze matrix calculation result. Matrix concatenation and recombination can also be done in the calculator, for example, to side-by-side compare multiple 3D matrices (Figure \ref{fig:MatrixCalcExample}). Some valid calculation examples are, but not limited to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A,B Combines A and B in one row
		\item A,B;C,D Combines A and B in the first row, C and D in the second row
		\item A,B;C,zeros(size(C)) Combines A and B in the first row, C in the second row, pad with zero value
		\item sin(A),cos(B) Calculates voxel-wise sin for A and cos for B, then combine them in one row
		\item A(:,1:10,:) Extracts submatrix from A and display it
	\end{itemize}
	
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Pictures/MatrixCalcExample.eps}
	\caption{MatrixUser Concatenation Example}
	\label{fig:MatrixCalcExample}
\end{figure}
	
where A, B, C and D are multi-dimensional matrices with proper matrix size. Also note that the source matrices have to stay in the base workspace for being referenced. Pressing the execution button will perform the calculation and save the result as a temporary matrix. The user can also save the temporary matrix into workspace by pressing matrix saving button. The saved temporary matrix will have a `\_tmp' suffix by default.
	
	\item Matrix Display Axes \\
	
The display axes renders an image for one slice of current matrix. The user can use mouse cursor to inspect the coordinate and value of any voxel. Moving mouse wheel back and forth moves the slice location along current dimension and updates the display axes.
	
	\item Matrix Color Control Group \\
	
	The matrix color control group provides a set of sliders, editboxes and popup menu which help control image color scheme and contrast. This group consists of
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Colormap Popup Menu: Choose different colormap scheme
		\item Upper Color Bound Slider (right slider): Slide to control the upper bound of color limits
		\item Upper Color Bound EditText (right editbox): Edit to control the upper bound of color limits
		\item Lower Color Bound Slider (left slider): Slide to control the lower bound of color limits
		\item Lower Color Bound EditText (left editbox): Edit to control the lower bound of color limits
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Matrix Dimension Control Group \\
	
	MatrixUser measures the dimension size of the display matrix and assigns one slider and editbox for each dimension that is above 2 (i.e. no slider and editbox for the first and second dimension). These control items are located in individual dimension tab and can be used to switch among slices in current active dimension.
